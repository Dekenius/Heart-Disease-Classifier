## Purpose / Background

## Algorithms Used

1. k Nearest Neighbors
2. Linear SVM
3. RBF SVM
4. Gaussian Process
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
~~7. Neural Net~~
8. AdaBoost
9. Naive Bayes
10. QDA

## Dataset

[Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)

## Process Overview

### Feature Engineering
1. Data Preprocessing / Preparation (cleaning, normalization, transformation): 
2. Feature Extraction (combining existing features to produce a more useful one):
3. Feature Selection (selecting the most useful features to train on among the existing ones):
<space><space> The database linked above contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. Specific Information available in the link under Dataset.
